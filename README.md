# Data-Science-Final
For this data science project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about 150,000 different wines, most notably their descriptions and their quality, denoted by a Sommeliers point designation. I will be creating a Streamlit dashboard that displays my data analysis which will include word cloud visualization, a machine learning model, and an analysis of wine variety per country.

The user will be able to create a word cloud for all the wines in a country, a province within that country, or a region within that province. This will display the most used words for every wine in the respective geographical designation which can give the user insight into the key features of wines in this region.

Moreover, I will have a page in my Streamlit app that displays a predictive machine learning model. I will be creating a machine model that is able to predict the quality of a wine, denoted by the points awarded by a professional sommelier, by using the various wine descriptions. We notice in some preliminary analysis that higher rated wines tend to have longer average descriptions.

Lastly, I will be displaying the type and quality of wine by country. I will be displaying a pie chart showing the top wine varieties ranked by average points awarded (max of 10) that are created in each country. I will also be displaying the top wineries in each country (max of 10) ranked by average points awarded.
